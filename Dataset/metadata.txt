⚙️ Data Integrity & Preprocessing Requirements
Raw values from the Factbook are human-readable and contain:

Unit suffixes (e.g., "sq km", "km", "m")
Percent signs ("%")
Thousands separators (e.g., "2,381,740")
Before quantitative analysis, perform data cleaning.

🔧 Required Cleaning Steps:
Remove unit labels, commas, and percentage signs.
Convert the cleaned columns to a numeric type (e.g., float).
🧹 Example Preprocessing Workflow (pandas)
# Cleaning a column with comma separators and unit suffix
df['Area_Total'] = (
    df['Area_Total']
      .str.replace(',', '', regex=True)
      .str.replace(' sq km', '', regex=True)
      .astype(float)
)
